      <Text style={styles.infoText}>
        I consider myself a pro-active and responsible person, where through the
        years and experience received, I managed to form me with virtues, which
        I would love to bring to a team. I am an advocate of innovation and
        teamwork. I care about fostering a work space where there is movement,
        creativity, listening, commitment, respect and responsibility. One of
        the qualities that I consider most outstanding about me is my positive
        attitude. I make sure that every space where I work has a positive
        drive. If there are problems, let's look for solutions.
